# Grocery Store App with Create React App

[Live preview](https://shubsmastan-grocery-store-app.netlify.app/)<br />

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

This is an app created using React.js which emulates a simple shopping cart. It was an assignment created as part of the full-stack JavaScript pathway on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## How It Was Made

- I intitialised the app with create-react-app.
- I learnt how to use the useState hooks to update the shopping basket.
- I used Git to take regular snapshots and maintain a good workflow.
