# Grocery Store App Clone

[Live preview](https://shubsmastan-grocery-store-app.netlify.app/)<br />

This project was created with [React](https://react.dev/).

## Description

This is an app created using React.js which emulates a simple shopping cart. It was an assignment created as part of the full-stack JavaScript pathway on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## How It Was Made

- Using state hooks to conditionally render items in React.
- Using React Router to create routes to different pages of the app.
- Using Git to take regular snapshots and maintain a good workflow.
- Using Bootstrap to style the elements such as cards and header and use modals.
- Using Redux to manage the state throughout the app (2.0.1 update).
